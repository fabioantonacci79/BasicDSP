# Notebooks for supporting the learning of theory and applications of digital signal processing with a focus on audio signals.
Each notebook contains a few examples. Students can learn the code or play around with the examples to appreciate in practice the concepts introduced during classes. Most of the examples can be controlled with sliders. In parallel, the students can learn how to perform digital signal processing by examining the code more in depth.
## 01_sampling_quantization: 
analyze the basic concepts of sampling and quantization, with particular reference to aliasing (in time domain) and quantization noise. 
## 02_fft_spectrogram: 
introduce the fft and the spectrogram. It is possible to analyze the effects of aliasing in the frequency domain
## 03_filtering_time_frequency:
how to filter a signal in time and frequency domains
## 04_filter_design
Design of FIR filters using the minimax principle
## 05_adaptive_filtering_demo
Noise removal on a signal using Wiener, steepest descent and LMS adaptive filtering techniques
## 06_microphone_array_processing
Source localization (DOA estimation) on signals acquired by a uniform linear microphone array. Steered Response Power and beamforming are demonstrated
